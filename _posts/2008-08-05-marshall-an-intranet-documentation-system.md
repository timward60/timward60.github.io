Marshall, is an intranet documentation system that is being developed by Jason Maddocks, Matt White, [Andy Goh](http://andygoh.net/blog/), and myself. This system is being developed for <a href="">[AeroIT](http://www.aeroit.co.in/) as part of our final year industry project at [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu.au/) for the [Bachelor of Software Engineering](http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/courses/2008/undergraduate/2770/).  

The system allows for the creation of documents for supporting software systems provided by our client. These documents include workflows, screens, reports, fields, tables, and databases. The system can easily be extended to supporting other specific document types.  

The system is being developed as a web 2.0 application using the [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) framework.  

More information on the project can be seen in the interim presentation created for Marshall. Powerpoint Presentation - [Introducing Marshall 2008]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Introducing-Marshall-2008.pdf).
