During my summer vacation employment, I was lucky to meet a few interesting characters. One such character was Simon.  

Simon is a linux user who has stopped using Windows and now relies on [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/) for all his computing needs. Simon runs all his applications in console, including his MP3 playing and internet browsing.

This intrigued me as I was still mainly a Windows user, and part-time Ubuntu user. I still plan to continue using Windows as my main operating system due to my gaming interests, but with regards to Ubuntu, I was over the whole linux-based GUI. Most of my linux use was restricted to console in any case and I found the GUI very uninteresting. This is why I chose to move to a console world.  

At first I thought the Gentoo installation would be as simple as downloading the ISO off the Gentoo website, booting the operating system, and double-clicking the install button, just like Ubuntu. Unfortunately I was pleasantly suprised that the minimum install contains a minimal set of features (just as the website claimed) and to install the added features required entering a few extra commands. This is great, exactly what I wanted, but I forgot to print out any documentation or find out where documentation was stored for the installation. This set me back a day while I waited to organise the printing of the installation guide. Unfortunately my linux experience was restricted to basic shell tools and programming, I was not that familiar with the setup and installation tools provided by Linux.  

Fortunately I found this guide, [Gentoo Linux x86 Quick Install Guide](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-quickinstall.xml), on installation. Hopefully if all goes well in the next few days I will have Gentoo up and running.
