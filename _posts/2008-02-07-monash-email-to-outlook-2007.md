While at university I was in constant correspondence with lecturers, tutors, administration, and other students through the Monash email account they provide. Unfortunately my university email access is restricted to using webmail.  

Once upon a time Monash use to provide POP access, but they removed this and now POP can only be used by special request.  

The webmail interface provides a way of forwarding emails. It was decided I would set this to my private email. Unfortunately I have been using the webmail access for the past three years or so. This means over this time I have acquired some important emails over the course of my studies which I would like to keep.  

Thankfully there is a way to retrieve all the emails stored on the server to a zip file via the (Monash Email Archiving Tool)[http://www.its.monash.edu.au/students/email/archive/]. After requesting the file and further reading on the webmail website it said it is not possible to import the email formats directly to Outlook 2007.  

At first I just gived up, but fortunately with some spare time I continued my search for possible solutions. The webmail website lists that Mozilla Thunderbird can be used to import the emails. I downloaded Thunderbird, installed, and imported the emails. This was extremely easy. As the instructions list, simply copy the files into your Thunderbird mail folder. I had to initially create a fake account to allow creation of this folder and local mail folders.  

Outlook 2007 has no direct import functionality for Thunderbird. From my initial Google searches I came across this (forum topic)[http://www.techimo.com/forum/t146107.html]. The originator had given up searching for free options and settled with a commercial program that did importing.  

Lucky for me and my wallet, another poster commented on a method to translate the emails in to a format that Windows Mail could read. I used a program known as (IMAPsize)[http://www.broobles.com/imapsize/download.php]. After converting all the emails, I simply started Windows Mail, and dragged the emails into the Windows Mail window.  

I then used Outlook 2007 functionality to import the mail from Windows Mail. Finally my emails were copied across for my safe keeping.  

To ensure all future emails from Monash would remain seperate, I created another data file especially for these emails. I then added rules to move anything that is sent to my Monash address directly to move to this data file.  

I assume this would work for previous and future Outlook versions. Windows Mail is Window Vista's version of Outlook Express.
