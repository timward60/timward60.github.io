As part of my honours project I conducted a literature review of virtual machines for grid computing. The following excerpt details the structure of my literature review.  

> To greater understand what is required for incorporating virtualisation into grid computing; we will first look at high-performance computing and e-Science. This will look at the evolution of e-Science (Section 2) from its early period starting with cluster computing, its evolution in to grid computing, the introduction of scientific workflows, and finally the use of large-scale e-Science.  
>
> An understanding of the problems associated with the uptake and use of grid computing will be analysed to gain a greater understanding of what is required by e-Scientists in modern day computing for experimentation on the large-scale e-Science infrastructure.  
> 
> This will then be followed by a more technical look at virtualisation (Section 3), specifically examining virtualisation in high-performance computing, and how it is applied in grid computing. Emerging architectures will be discussed with a concentration on platform virtual machines as work units.  
>
> Finally this review will examine how platform virtual machine work units can be orchestrated across the grid including the configuration, deployment and execution of such units.
