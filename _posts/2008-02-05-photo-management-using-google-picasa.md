I have heard previous things about Picasa, but I never thought that my small photo collection would benefit from it. Unfortunately my photo collection has grown since this last thought and it was time to implement some form of photo management.  

After downloading and installation from the [Google Picasa website](http://picasa.google.com/), Picasa did a search for all images on my computer. Unfortunately this included images from Documents file which I really did not want. In folder settings I was fortunately given the ability to select what parts of my hard-drive are scanned for images.   

I simply removed Documents and selected Pictures solely for this purpose.

My photo collection was in a mess and it would take ages viewing and moving images using standard Windows Explorer. Using the features that provided ease-of-use it was no time before I had sorted most of my image collection. The complete randomness of my image collection was an issue and I guess from now I will take more care when storing images.
