The following is an excerpt taken from my honours project research proposal.  

> Grid computing has opened up possibilities for e-Scientists to conduct and collaborate on computer intensive experiments which would have once been infeasible[5]. The next generation of large scale experiments for E-Science requires access to large scale computing resources and data storage, and grid computing has made this possible. High-performance computing experiments can now be run without requiring direct access to a single super-computer.  
>
> These experiments are often represented by scientific workflows[19], which involve the break down of an experiment into logical and ordered components that may be responsible for collecting and processing data. These components may be dependent or a dependency for other components within the workflow. These scientific workflows have simplified the process of designing and executing scientific experiments.  
>
> Due to the nature of the computing landscape, grids commonly consist of heterogeneous resources; every resource on a grid can potentially have different physical characteristics and a different configuration. For an e-Scientist to successfully use the full potential of a grid they must tailor their experiment to run on all or a subset of these resources. In most cases an e-Scientist may have some experience in software development. However, their main concern is in their field of research. For e-scientists, the process of developing and deploying software across a range of platforms, configurations and organisational boundaries is challenging[6, 7].  
>  
> One approach to reducing the effort required for developing grid applications is using virtualisation to abstract resource characteristics and allow e-Scientists to define their own run-time environment for an experiment application[3]. Using this approach removes potential application development issues such as portability from the e-Scientistâ€™s responsibility. This can be achieved by using platform virtual machines, which emulate a complete machine including its hardware, operating system, and software. However this method still poses some problems for e-Scientists as the configuration of such environments can be time consuming and requires knowledge of operating systems concepts and system administration.
