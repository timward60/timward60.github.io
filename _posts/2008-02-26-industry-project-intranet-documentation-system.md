As part of my final year of software engineering I have to undertake an industry project alongside my honours project. Generally these projects involve the entire year working alongside an industry client and Monash supervisor for designing and developing a software system for the client's business. The actual project that we nominated and were allocated is a project on developing a intranet documentation system.  

Project work is team based and in this case consists of four other software engineering students. My project team consists of Jason Maddocks, Andy Goh, and Matt White. Jason and Andy are both fellow honour students, and I have previously worked in other university projects alongside Jason and Matt. Hopefully this team with a wide range of skills will deliver the required software system as required by the client and meets their expectations.
