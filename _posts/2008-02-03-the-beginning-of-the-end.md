I've never thought much of blogs. Yes occasionally they make for interesting reading and sometimes they even contain useful information. This is the direction I want to head in.  

I'm about to embark on my final year of university studying software engineering. This is why I created this blog, to begin in some small manner of contributing to information technology industry.  

How will I contribute, I do not know... but I believe that if I begin to document my experiences that I may eventually stumble on something interesting that other people will enjoy and gain from.
