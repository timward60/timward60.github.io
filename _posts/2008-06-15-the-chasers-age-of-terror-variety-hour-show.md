Last night I was luckily enough to attend the "The Chaser's" theatre performance known as the "The Chaser's Age of Terror Variety". This show took place at the Athenauem on Collins St, Melbourne.  

Not knowing what to expect completely and a bit weary of what was going to happened knowing what the Chaser's are known for. I love the Chaser's TV shows on the ABC that involve sketches that have improvisation involving the public, however for some of their normal sketches without public interaction occasionally I thought were less or average in comedic value. Not to say that their TV show is not worth viewing, I think its one of the greatest shows on television.  

To be honest I extremely enjoyed their stage show. They provided laughs throughout the entire show and the audience was in stitches for most of the show. They interacted with the audience and even at some stages got some people joining the show. They also used improvisation from the audience to provide some great humour. They use recent happenings in the news, and also provide some humour directed at themselves.  

This was one of the great comedy shows I have seen, and I enjoyed every minute of it until it ended. I applaud the Chaser team for their show and I recommend it for anybody wanting a good hour and half of humour.
